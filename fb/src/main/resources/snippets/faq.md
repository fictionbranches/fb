# Fiction Branches FAQ

- An episode has a problem (misspelled words, bad grammar, illegal content, breaks story continuity, etc). What should I do?
    - Use the `Flag episode` link at the top of the episode to report the issue to moderators. (At this time we don't have a nice way for you to know the results of these flags, sorry).

- I found a problem with the site itself (something isn't working the way it's supposed to). What should I do? 
    - Report the problem in `#bugreports` on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eGPxp5A).

- There are a *lot* of episodes, how can I search for particular one? 
    - You can search any story or subtree using the `Search from here` link at the top of an episode. Fiction Branches search also supports some [advanced features](/fb/search).

- How can I support Fiction Branches?
    - For one thing, you can flag episodes that are inappropriate, illegal, not in continuity with the branch, or contain bad spelling or grammar. 
    - Right now we only accept donations via Bitcoin (use the link at the bottom of every page), but are planning to add a more straightforward means of donating in the near future.

- I have a question, but you didn't answer it anywhere on this page.
    - We would be happy to help you in person in `#help` on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eGPxp5A)! 

- What is love?
    - Baby don’t hurt me. Don’t hurt me. No more.
