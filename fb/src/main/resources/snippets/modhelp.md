## Flag queue

The [flag queue](/fb/flagqueue) contains flagged episodes. Any logged in user may flag any episode.

If a flag is actionable, you must go to the relevant episode (which will be linked on the page of the flag) and modify it yourself using the *Modify as moderator* link at the top.

Once you are done with a flag, either because you have taken appropriate action or because no action is warranted, use the *Delete this flag* link at the top of the flag page to remove the flag from the queue.

## Mod queue

The [mod queue](/fb/modqueue) contains requests from users to modify their own episode. Users can only submit these requests on episodes they own, and only if said episode contains children not owned by the same user (this is to prevent storyline inconsistencies in branches written by multiple authors). It is your job as moderator to ensure that the proposed modification does not break the storyline of any child episodes.

The modify page will contain the suggested new version of the episode, and will have a link at the top to the current version of the episode.

If the modification is acceptable, use the *Accept modification* link at the top to apply the modification to the live episode and rmeove it from the mod queue.

If the modification is not acceptable, use the *Reject modification* link at the top to remove it from the mod queue.
